    <p>Cast your eyes now toward the city of Austin, TX.</p>

    <p>
    There, squirreled away amongst shelves of books and games, you might find a patchwork of writers shouting boisterously about their favorite stories and character arcs. A friendly smattering of creative minds and delightful lunatics, with the audacity to share a story or two.

    Among the offerings from this humble writing group, a kaleidoscope of musings:

    A young woman determined to rectify her wayward dating life against her responsibility at the babysitter for an eldritch god.

    A carefully-lain heist for a legendary spice that transgresses into something full-up with shadows.

    A machine that grants a tantalizing opportunityâ€”to relive your most important memories, even the ones that destroyed you.

    A man whose opinion on reality is generously speaking, somewhat tenuous.

    A wise-cracking camel. The best kind of camel.

    Would you look at that, there's even some poetry.

    These along with other wonderful, creative labors, fill the pages of this, the debut collection of the Onwards writing community.
